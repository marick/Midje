;;; When you have many similar tests, you can use *tabular facts* to
;;; clarify what's special about each test. Here, for example, is a tabular
;;; fact about addition:

(tabular "tabular facts can take a doc string"
 (fact (+ ?a ?b) => ?result )
 ?a    ?b      ?result
 1     2       3
 1     0       1)

;;; You can use the repl tools to work with tabular facts just as you
;;; can any other top-level fact:

(fact
  (map fact-description (fetch-facts *ns* "tabular facts can take a doc string"))
  => ["tabular facts can take a doc string"])

;;; On failure, the line number points to the fact, but the message
;;; is annotated with information about the substitutions.
