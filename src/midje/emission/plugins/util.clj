;; from failing *facts* to appear within the clojure.test segment of
;; summary output. That doesn't work (though it works fine for
;; clojure.test output). The whole rigamarole is boring and I don't
;; care to jump through any more hoops. I say it's spinach, and I say
;; to hell with it.

;; (Don't change this to println, though. That doesn't work either.
;; Newlines are lost.)
