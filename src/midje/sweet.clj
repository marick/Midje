   `against-background` can be used in two ways. In the first, it has
   a `let`-like syntax that wraps a series of facts:

      (against-background [(f 33) => 12

        (fact...)
        (fact...))

   In the second, it can be placed as either the first or last form in
   a fact, in which case it is taken to \"wrap\" the entire fact:

     (against-background (f 1) => :default, (g 1) => :default)
