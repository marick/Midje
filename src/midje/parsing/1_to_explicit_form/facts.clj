;; There are three stages to fact processing:
;; * Body processing: the convertion of arrow and provided forms into their
;;   explicit forms, the insertion of background data, line numbering, etc.
;;
;; * Compendium processing: wrapping the body in a function form that supports
;;   rerunning and history keeping.
;;
;; * Load-time processing: wrapping the final form in code that does whatever
;;   should be done the first time the fact is loaded. (Such as running it for
;;   the first time.)
