;; We go to some trouble to have a mostly-consistent interface to the functions
;; {load,fetch,check,forget}-facts. The arguments to the functions are bundled
;; together into a map that controls:
;;
;; Which namespaces should be used.
;; Which output should be printed
;; Whether facts in namespaces should be filtered.
;; Whether the default case for future uses should be changed.


;; The `:all` keyword means "do this function to all namespaces".

;; Defaulting. The basic rule for defaults is that if you don't
;; mention a namespace in a command, the previous print levels,
;; filters, and namespaces are reused. If you do, all of them are
;; replaced.

;; Further, loading has a different way of working with namespaces
;; than the other functions. (For example, it supports wildcards.)
;; Moreover, loading affects the defaults for other functions, but
;; other functions don't affect loading defaults.

;; So there are two sets of defaults: one for `:disk-commands` and one
;; for `:memory-commands`. As a trick to eliminate some if statements,
;; the respective "command types" are used to store the namespace
;; defaults.

(defn autotest
  "`autotest` checks frequently for changed files. It reloads those files
  and all files that depend on them. Since test files depend on source files,
  that typically results in facts being reloaded and checked.

  By default, `autotest` monitors all the files in the
  project.clj's :source-paths and :test-paths. To change the
  default, give the `:files` argument:

     (autotest :files \"test/midje/util\" \"src/midje/util\")
     (autotest :files \"test/midje/util/t_unify.clj\" \"src/midje/util/unify.clj\")

  This is useful in large projects. Note that `autotest` doesn't follow
  dependencies outside the given directories. If `test/midje/util/A`
  depends on `some-untracked-dir/B` that depends on `src/midje/util/C`,
  a change to `C` will not cause `A` to be reloaded.

  You can revert back to the project.clj versions like this:

    (autotest :all)

  You can filter the facts checked by giving more arguments following
  a `:filter` or `:filters` keyword:

    (autotest :filter :integration)

  Facts matching any of the arguments are the ones that are
  checked. The arguments can be of these types:

  :keyword      -- Does the metadata have a truthy value for the keyword?
  \"string\"    -- Does the fact's name contain the given string?
  #\"regex\"    -- Does any part of the fact's name match the regex?
  a function    -- Does the function return a truthy value when given
                   the fact's metadata?

  `autotest` can take special keyword arguments:

     (autotest :stop)   ; stop checking
     (autotest :pause)  ; pause checking
     (autotest :resume) ; continue after a pause

  `autotest` can also be given an `:interval` argument to control how often
  it checks for modified files. The argument is in milliseconds:

      (autotest :interval 1000) ; check each second.

  The default is to check twice each second.
