;; TODO: I'm not wild about signalling failure in two ways: by report() and by
;; return value. Fix this when (a) we move away from clojure.test.report and
;; (b) we figure out how to make fact() some meaningful unit of reporting.
;;
;; Later note: this doesn't actually work well anyway when facts are nested within
;; larger structures. Probably fact should return true/false based on interior failure
;; counts.
