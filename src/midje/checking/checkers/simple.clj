   The most common cases are:
       (fact (foo) => (throws IOException)
       (fact (foo) => (throws IOException #\"No such file\")

   `throws` takes three kinds of arguments:
   * A class argument requires that the Throwable be of that class.
   * A string or regular expression requires that the `message` of the Throwable
     match the argument.
   * A function argument requires that the function, when applied to the Throwable,
     return a truthy value.

   Arguments can be in any order. Except for a class argument, they can be repeated.
   So, for example, you can write this:
       (fact (foo) => (throws #\"one part\" #\"another part\"))"
