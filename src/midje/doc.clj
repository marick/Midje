  Here are Midje repl functions. Use `doc` for more info on each one.
  To control verbosity of output, use the print levels described by
  `(doc midje-print-levels)`.
  Some functions take filter arguments that narrow down which facts
  within a namespace are acted upon. See the individual doc strings
  for details.

  ----- Autotest

  (autotest)       ; Reload changed files and all their dependents.

  ----- Loading facts
  You load facts by namespace.
  (load-facts <ns> <ns>...)
  (load-facts 'midje.util.*)      ; Load all namespaces below midje.util.
  (load-facts <ns> :integration)  ; Filter to just integration tests.
  (load-facts)                    ; Repeat most recent load-facts.

  ----- Checking facts, once loaded
  (check-facts <ns> <ns>...)        ; in given namespaces
  (check-facts :all)                ; all defined facts
  (check-facts :all :integration)   ; all integration tests

  Note: `check-facts` with no argument will check the same facts
  as the most recent `check-facts` or `load-facts`.

  ----- Rerunning facts
  (recheck-fact)                ; Check just-checked fact again.
  (recheck-fact :print-nothing) ; Check silently (but produce true/false).
  (rcf)                         ; Synonym for above.

  Note: facts with `:check-only-at-load-time` metadata do not get
  stored for rechecking.

  ----- Forgetting facts
  Same notation as the `check-facts` family, but with
  \"forget\" instead of \"check\".

  ----- Fetching facts
  Same notation as the `check-facts` family, but with
  \"fetch\" instead of \"check\".
  To check the returned facts, use `check-one-fact`:
     (map check-one-fact (fetch-facts :all))

  In addition, you can fetch the last fact checked with
  `(last-fact-checked)`. `(source-of-last-fact-checked)`
  gives you its source.

  To query fact metadata more easily, use these:
  -- (fact-name <ff>)         ; result might be nil
  -- (fact-source <ff>)
  -- (fact-file <ff>)
  -- (fact-line <ff>)
  -- (fact-namespace <ff>)    ; a symbol
  -- (fact-description <ff>)  ; the doc string; might be nil
  "} midje-repl)


;; print-levels
(def ^{:doc "
  The `load-facts`, `check-facts`, and `recheck-fact`
  functions normally print any fact failures and a final
  summary. The detail printed can be adjusted by passing
  either certain keywords or corresponding numbers to the
  functions. (The numbers are easier to remember.)
  For example, here's how you check all facts in the most
  verbose way:
    (check-facts :all 2)
    (check-facts :all :print-facts)

  Here are all the variants:

  :print-normally     (0)  -- failures and a summary.
  :print-no-summary  (-1)  -- failures only.
  :print-nothing     (-2)  -- nothing is printed.
                           -- (but return value can be checked)
  :print-namespaces   (1)  -- print the namespace for each group of facts.
  :print-facts        (2)  -- print fact descriptions in addition to namespaces.

  Any function can be used on the right-hand side of a check:
      (fact 500 => (fn [actual] (> actual 100)))

  In the left-hand side of a prerequisite, use `checker` or
  `as-checker` to define the checker:
      (provided
         (f (checker [arg] (> arg 100))) => 3
         (h (as-checker even?)) => 4)

  Checkers can be named with `defchecker`:
        (defchecker twosie [actual]
           (and (pos? actual) (even? actual)))
        (fact 2 => twosie)

        (defchecker roughly [expected delta]

  Chatty checkers print the values of subexpressions in the
  case of a failure:

       (fact 4 => (chatty-checker [actual] (< (h actual) (g actual))))

  Use `every-checker` or `some-checker` to define checkers for
  boolean expressions:

       (def pleasingly-positive (every-checker number? even? pos?))
       (fact 4 => pleasingly-positive)

(def ^{:doc "
   Background-changers are discouraged in favor of `with-state-changes`
   and `prerequisites`, but they still may sometimes be needed.

   There are two types of background-changers. The first provides a default
   prerequisite and has the same format as `provided`. Here's an example of
   two inside in a `background` form:

      (background (f 33) => 12, (f 34) => 21)

   The other form runs arbitrary code before, after, or around a fact or
   individual check. Here's how you execute some setup code before each of a
   series of facts:

      (against-background [(before :facts (reset! some-atom 0))]
         (fact ...)
         (fact ...))

   Here's how you execute some code after each check in a fact:

      (against-background [(after :checks (reset! some-atom 0))]
        (fact
          (f 1) => 2   ; Reset happens after.
          (f 2) => 3)) ; Reset happens after.

   You can execute code both before and after a fact like this:

      (against-background [(before :facts (reset! in-atom 0)
                                   :after (reset! out-atom 0))]
         (fact ...)
         (fact ...))

   You can also wrap code around a fact or check:

      (against-background [(around :facts (sql/with-connection db ?form))]
         ...)

   The two types of background-changers can be intermingled.
